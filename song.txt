[Intro]
She told me to follow, it feel just like water
It feel like a river, I'll never forgive her
Got lost in the shadows, been calling forever
I thought you had told me that this was forever

[Chorus]
Don't tell me more lies, I just wanna go home
Need some more time, feel the envy I loathe
Least I'm on fire, feel the scent of that smoke
Smoke, yeah-yeah
Don't tell me more lies, I just wanna go home
Need some more time, feel the envy I loathe
Least I'm on fire, I just wanna go home
Home, yeah-yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't wrote a verse in a minute, too busy handling business
Went for a drive and fucked around and crash-landed the civic
I feel the time that we live in I can't feel how I'm feeling
Unless I catch me a billion and walk it straight out the building
I feel the cancer that living and dancing all in my mentions
I feel gargantuan puddles that filled with acid and [?]
While I been dressed for the storm since my adolescent depression
I'm feeling tired of hearing voices yelling "Fuck your intentions"
I'm out in Dallas getting cold feet
Walk into the lobby, trade a lesson for a nosebleed
Probably want a problem with the boy 'cause they ain't know me
Or know them, or know nothing, no God above he
Mind flying way up above, skydiving
High five and show my enemies love, outside I
Ain't silent, this ain't deprivation, this is grinding
On fire like I fell in the Sun

[Chorus]
Don't tell me more lies, I just wanna go home
Need some more time, feel the envy I loathe
Least I'm on fire, feel the scent of that smoke
Smoke, yeah-yeah
Don't tell me more lies, I just wanna go home
Need some more time, feel the envy I loathe
Least I'm on fire, I just wanna go home
Home, yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
I spent my life writing this, don't wear my time on my wrist
Look in my eyes you gon' see something that I always miss
Taking the highest of risks, lay on my trails and trips
Take 'em to trial but would you rather be right or be rich? (Yeah)
Cost something I never had
Lost out loud, time ticking don't get it back
Used to be afraid of what's to come and what already had
The moment that it hit me, I was already moving past
You never gon' know the vibe missing of slow
The time live it on go 'cause why limit your soul
To five minutes left home is why I was given a throne
Of high interests alone the sky limit my bones, not my digits

[Chorus]
Don't tell me more lies, I just wanna go home
Need some more time, feel the envy I loathe
Least I'm on fire, feel the scent of that smoke
Smoke, yeah-yeah
Don't tell me more lies, I just wanna go home
Need some more time, feel the envy I loathe
Least I'm on fire, I just wanna go home
Home, yeah-yeah


[Outro]
She told me to follow, it feel just like water
It feel like a river, I'll never forgive her
Got lost in the shadows, been calling forever
I thought you had told me that this was forever
